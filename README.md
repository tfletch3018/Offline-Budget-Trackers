# Offline-Budget-Trackers

## Description
- The task was to add functionality to an existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The additional funcionality enables a user to add expenses and deposits to her budget without a connection.  Additionally, transactions that are entered offline, are then available to our user once back online
- To acheive this, a number of dependencies have been incorporated including Express, Compression, Mongoose, Morgan and Lite-Server as well as a MongoDb.
- This application gave me the opportunity to work with Mongo and gain an understanding of some of its advantages.  It is an excellent tool for managing a data structure that will evelove over time. It also provides a fully functional JavaScript environment for use wih a MongoDB.

## User Story
AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

## Business Context
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a user is on Budget App without an internet connection
WHEN the user inputs a withdrawal or deposit
THEN that will be shown on the page, and added to their transaction history when their connection is back online.
